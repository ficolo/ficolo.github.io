subtitle: "A (kind of) deterministic approach to make small Colombian corn-based hot pockets"
description: "They are savoury, full of joy and flavour, you can have them with coffee, with fresh juice, a pint of beer or long glass of lulada. Empanadas are a national treasure, a testament of the diversity of Latin America and the resistance and resilience of Colombian people."

<p>In the crossroad of the arabic ancestry brought to South America by the Spanish conquerors, the ingredients used by the Native American people and the culinary techniques of the enlasved African people, empanadas are a testament and a daily life celebration of our diversity as South Americans. You can find docens of versions of empanadas from the RÃ­o Bravo to the Patagonia, even in Colombia you can find a different empanada recipe in every region you visit. This is my dad's empanada's recipe, and I think it comes from the Valle del Cauca/Eje Cafetero region.</p>
